It now seems we're in the framework era. Everybody comes up with a new MVC Web
Framework and the Views are always the same: some HTML template with private
element to provide basic programming logic to render the dynamic content...
They all always suffer of the same 2 issues: Web Pages are neither debuggable
nor testable.

Jamal is not a full MVC Web Framework; it's just a Java library with a lot of
syntactic sugar to programmatically generate XHTML pages on server side.
Being plain Java code it's fully debuggable (just put a breakpoint wherever you
want) and even fully testable (for those who will) !
